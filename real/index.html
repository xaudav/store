            <p>The history of BMS institutions rewinds back to the year 1946 with the establishment of the first private engineering college in the country, BMS College of Engineering  (BMSCE), by late Sri B.M Sreenivasaiah. He was a philanthropist and a great visionary who realised the necessity of technical education even before the country got independence. He was honoured by the Maharaja of Mysore with the title “Dharma Prakasha Raja Karya Prasaktha” for his extraordinary service in the field of education. The legacy he once began is being upheld with the same zeal by his inheritors and they continue to cherish his vision and ideals.

            After the sad demise of Sri B.M Sreenivasaiah, his renowned son, Sri B.S Narayan, a vibrant and ingenious personality, moulded BMS College of Engineering into one of the finest engineering colleges. Apart from BMS College of Engineering, he had also established other institutions that promoted higher education which includes BMS College of Law, BMS College of Women and BMS Evening College of Engineering. He was extremely supportive in the initiation of several collaborative programs such as training foreign students under International Co-operative Division, cross cultural program with Melton Foundation U.S.A etc.

            BMS Institute of Technology & Management (BMSIT&M), established in the year 2002 under   BMS   Educational Trust,  being  managed  by a   council   of   trustees appointed by   Dr. B.S. Ragini Narayan,  the successor  of Late  Sri B.S Narayan and the Donor Trustee and Member Secretary of BMS Educational Trust and it is one of the best engineering college in Bangalore.</p>
